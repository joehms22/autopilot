	ping += 0x75, 0x65, 0x01, 0x02, 0x02, 0x01;
	std::vector<uint8_t> checksum = compute_checksum(ping);
	ping.insert(ping.end(), checksum.begin(), checksum.end());

	bool ack_received = false;
	while (!ack_received)
	{
		write(IMU::getInstance()->fd_ser, &ping[0], ping.size());
		ack_handler ping_ack(0x01);
		boost::signals2::scoped_connection c(IMU::getInstance()->ack.connect(boost::bind(&ack_handler::operator(), boost::ref(ping_ack), _1)));
		ping_ack.wait_for_ack();
		if (ping_ack.get_error_code() == 0x00)
